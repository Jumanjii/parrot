# ![Image of parrot](https://github.com/Jumanjii/parrot/blob/master/logo.png)Parrot - A simple echo server


Parrot is a simple echo server that can be used to store some text and retrieve it.

It's a minimalist personal past.bin that can be used to have a dedicated address when
we can put text and get it easily from another device for exemple.

(I use it to copy paste url between my smartphone and my browser for example ^_^).
