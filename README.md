# ![Image of parrot](https://github.com/Jumanjii/parrot/blob/master/logo.png)Parrot - A simple echo server


Parrot is a simple echo server that can be used to store some text and retrieve it.

It's a minimalist personal past.bin that can be used to have a dedicated web address where to put text and get it easily from another device.

(I use it to copy-paste url between my smartphone and my browser)
